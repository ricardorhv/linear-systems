# Organization

- [ ] Find the line with more 0 from index 0 or 1 and bring down
- [ ] Verify if the first line and first column is equals 0; If it's true, then change the line for another line that is different from 0 and it might be 1

# Calculations

- [ ] Verify if the columns before the column that the algorithm wants to zero is equals to 0, or else that line can't be used by the program to zero the value
- [ ] Priorize the number one, so, try to find the number one correspondent to the column that the algorithm wants to zero; Or else, just find any value that is different from 0
